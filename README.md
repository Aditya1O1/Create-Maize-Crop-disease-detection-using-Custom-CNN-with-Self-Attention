Designed and fine-tuned a custom CNN model with integrated Self-Attention mechanism to classify maize crop diseases, enhancing focus on critical image regions for improved feature extraction.

Achieved 91.53% validation accuracy after 15 training epochs by applying advanced data preprocessing, regularization techniques, and careful model tuning.

Optimized model using Batch Normalization, Global Average Pooling, and Dropout, significantly reducing overfitting and achieving robust generalization on maize leaf disease datasets.
